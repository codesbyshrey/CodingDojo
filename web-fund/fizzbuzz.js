// Classic Interview Question
// For each number multiple of 3, print Fizz
// For each number multiple of 5, print Buzz
// For numbers that meet both critera, print FizzBuzz
// All other numbers should just print normally
// Consider the modulo operator a % b (can just look for && loop with || nested inside)


var number = 0;

// for loop

console.log(number);

/* Loops Challenges After:
     get comfortable with for, while, if/else
     print odds 1-20 with console.log
     write loop s codes to decreasing multiples of 3 from 100 to 0
     loop code to print 4, 2.5, 1, -0.5, -2, -3.5
     write code to add all values from 1-100 to sum var and print 1+2+...+100 and get 5050
     write code to multiple all values 1-12 onto product var and r esult 1*2*3*4 etc to get back 479001600

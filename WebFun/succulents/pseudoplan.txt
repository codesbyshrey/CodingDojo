General Notes on my thoughts to proceed
5 hours of total time
Things to get done and loose order to get them done in?

1. Create top flex navbar with HTML and CSS. May as well enable functionality of the cart button along the way since it's a fairly simple one to enable.

2. Create the fixed cookie at the bottom of the page, and enable it's functionality to disappear when the button is clicked. This step should at most get you to 90 minutes into the exam or so if you're going at a comfortable pace.

3. Create the large flex container for majority of items on the page, consider DojoWeather as a good indicator of how to proceed. Middle section is enabled like video preview, I would say enable that once the spacing is established. We can pretty up the colors later, just leave it black and white for now.

4. Add the bottom container with all of the respective images and such. Go back and pretty up the webpage. Look through CSS for too many repeated elements to conveniently build up the page.

 - Create a top flex navbar for the entire page.
  --> this will have a top div that's similar to flex navbar, seems like roughly even spacing throughout so you can probably do justify-content space between or space evenly
  --> second div below it to act as a menu bar, just several pieces of text boxes instead of using the buttons and so on

   - Create a large flex container for the main items on the page.

    --> Centered h3 heading "Your Source for Serious Succulent Specialties"
    --> Left column div with flex 3, right with flex 2. Alternatively make it three columns with flex 3, flex 3, and flex 4.
    --> right column is easy, just has an image and a text box below with a certain background
    --> bottom area is a footer navbar like pfp with all of the images evenly spaced across the bottom. Should be easy enough to address.

    --> ** middle column / left column image holder should mimic our video preview exercise, but instead of an mp4, we want it to cycle through image elements (maybe we should put them in an array?) main image returns once the mouse moves away though
    --> mwahaha let's just do it like the video preview at the very start so i can continuously view a comparison of what mine should look like to what it currently does look like.


 - Create a cookie element at the bottom just like DojoWeather more or less, and make the box disappear when you click I accept.
  - Clicking the cart icon should create an alert signifying that the cart is empty. This should be a simple enough functionality.
